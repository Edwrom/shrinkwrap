# Shrinkwrap JOSM Plugin

This plugin is a collection of three actions to create:
* A [convex hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull) around the selection
* A "shrinkwrapped" way (concave hull) around the selection
* A "ballooned" way (inner concave hull?) around the cursor

[Usage](USAGE.md)  
[Examples](EXAMPLES.md)
